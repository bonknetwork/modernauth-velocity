## **Our Mission with ModernAuth**

ModernAuth's goal is to simplify and revolutionize authentication on offline-mode (cracked) Minecraft servers. By automating password resets and reducing the need for human intervention, we strive to create a more secure, user-friendly environment for both players and server administrators.

Our system drastically streamlines account recovery and password management, eliminating the frustrations associated with lost credentials. In doing so, we allow server owners to focus on delivering the best possible gameplay experience rather than spending time on manual authentication tasks. ModernAuth is designed to protect against unauthorized access, simplify user logins, and ensure that communities can thrive without compromising on convenience or security. We believe that by removing barriers to seamless authentication, we can make Minecraft servers more accessible, enjoyable, and trustworthy for all.

## **How It Works**

ModernAuthentication integrates with a backend API to handle player authentication. Here's an overview of the process:

1. **Player Joins**:
   - When a player joins the Velocity proxy, the plugin checks if they are registered with the backend.
   - If the player is not registered, they are prompted to switch to ModernAuth using a clickable message.

2. **Switching to ModernAuth**:
   - If the player clicks the confirmation message or types `/modernconfirm yes`, the plugin starts the authentication flow.
   - The player is sent a link to complete the authentication process.

3. **Authentication**:
   - The player clicks the link to authenticate via the ModernAuth system.
   - Once authenticated, the player is logged in automatically.

4. **Fallback**:
   - If the player chooses not to switch (`/modernconfirm no`), they can continue using their current login method.

## **Installation**

   - Download the latest `ModernAuthentication.jar` from the [releases page](#) (or build it yourself).

2. **Install the Plugin**:
   - Place the `ModernAuthentication.jar` file in your Velocity server's `plugins` folder.

3. **Start the Server**:
   - Start the Velocity server. The plugin will generate a `config.yml` file in the `plugins/ModernAuthentication` folder.

## **Configuration**

After the plugin generates the `config.yml` file, open it and configure the following settings:

### Example `config.yml`:

```yaml
# The URL of your authentication backend.
backendUrl: "https://auth.bonkmc.org"

# The port on which your backend is running.
backendPort: 443

# The access code used when communicating with the backend API.
access-code: "your_access_code_here"

# The public server ID used in the link sent to players.
server-id: "server-id-here"
